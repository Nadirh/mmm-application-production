## 📋 **Immediate Action Items**

**For next session, start with:**

1. **Test the current application** (`Phase 1` items)
   - Run `docker-compose up` to verify services start
   - Execute `pytest tests/` to validate all functionality
   - Test a complete workflow from upload to optimization

2. **If testing reveals issues:**
   - Debug and fix any failing tests
   - Address configuration or dependency problems
   - Validate Docker setup and Redis connectivity

3. **If testing is successful:**
   - Move to CI/CD setup (`Phase 2`)
   - Begin frontend planning (`Phase 3`)
   - Or focus on production readiness (`Phase 4`)

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

- **Phase 1**: All tests pass, application runs end-to-end
- **Phase 2**: Automated deployments with <5min build times
- **Phase 3**: Full-featured dashboard with real-time updates
- **Phase 4**: Production deployment handling 100+ concurrent users
- **Phase 5**: Advanced features improving model accuracy by 10%+
- **Phase 6**: Complete documentation enabling self-service adoption

## 📝 **Notes**

- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLite/PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, React/TypeScript
- **Testing**: pytest, comprehensive coverage across API, mathematical, integration, performance
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production
- **Architecture**: Microservices-ready with clear separation of concerns
