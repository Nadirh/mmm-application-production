# Security and Privacy Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security and privacy measures implemented in the MMM application to ensure complete data isolation between clients and protection of sensitive marketing data.

## 🔒 Core Security Principles

### 1. Zero-Trust Architecture
- **No shared resources**: Each client's data is completely isolated
- **Principle of least privilege**: Users only access what they need
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Assume breach**: Design assumes attackers may gain initial access

### 2. Data Classification
All data is classified into four sensitivity levels:
- **Restricted**: Client financial and marketing spend data
- **Confidential**: Model parameters and optimization results
- **Internal**: Application metrics and performance data
- **Public**: Non-sensitive metadata

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

### Client Data Segregation

Each client's data is isolated through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Cryptographic Isolation**
   - Unique encryption key per client derived from master key
   - Client-specific key derivation using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)
   - All data encrypted at rest using AES-256

2. **Storage Isolation**
   - Separate storage paths per client with hashed identifiers
   - Directory permissions restricted to 0700 (owner only)
   - No cross-client file system access possible

3. **Database Isolation**
   - Client ID embedded in all database records
   - Row-level security policies enforced
   - Queries automatically filtered by client context

4. **Session Isolation**
   - Client context validated on every request
   - Cross-client access attempts immediately blocked and logged
   - Sessions expire after configurable duration (default 8 hours)

### Implementation Example

```python
# Data storage with client isolation
file_id, path = data_isolation_manager.store_client_file(
    client_id="client_123",
    file_data=csv_bytes,
    filename="marketing_data.csv",
    metadata={"user_id": "user_456", "upload_time": datetime.now()}
)

# Attempting cross-client access (will be blocked)
try:
    data = data_isolation_manager.retrieve_client_file(
        client_id="different_client",  # Different client ID
        file_id=file_id,
        user_id="user_456"
    )
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Access denied - file doesn't exist for this client
    pass
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Username/password as first factor
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as second factor
- Optional hardware key support (FIDO2/WebAuthn)

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Viewer** | View results only |
| **Analyst** | Upload data, train models, run optimizations |
| **Manager** | All analyst permissions + user management |
| **Admin** | Full access to organization data |
| **Super Admin** | System-level access (internal only) |

### JWT Token Security
- Short-lived tokens (8-hour default)
- Encrypted session storage
- Automatic token rotation
- Revocation support

## 🔏 Encryption Standards

### Data at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Client-specific keys with PBKDF2 derivation
- **File Storage**: All uploaded files encrypted before storage
- **Database**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for production

### Data in Transit
- **TLS Version**: Minimum TLS 1.2, preferred TLS 1.3
- **Cipher Suites**: Only strong ciphers (no RC4, 3DES)
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict certificate checking
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled

### Key Rotation
- Automatic key rotation every 90 days
- Old keys retained for decryption only
- Zero-downtime rotation process

## 📊 Audit Logging

### Comprehensive Activity Tracking

All data access is logged with the following information:
- **Who**: User ID and organization
- **What**: Action performed and resource accessed
- **When**: Timestamp with timezone
- **Where**: IP address and user agent
- **Result**: Success or failure with error details

### Audit Log Examples

```json
{
  "audit_id": "audit_abc123",
  "client_id": "client_123",
  "user_id": "user_456",
  "action": "data:upload",
  "resource_type": "file",
  "resource_id": "file_789",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "success": true
}
```

### Audit Log Retention
- Minimum 7 years for compliance (GDPR Article 30)
- Encrypted and tamper-evident storage
- Regular integrity checks

## 🗑️ Data Retention & Deletion

### Automated Lifecycle Management

| Data Type | Default Retention | Action After Expiry |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Upload Files | 1 year | Secure deletion |
| Model Results | 2 years | Archive or delete |
| Optimization Results | 2 years | Archive or delete |
| Audit Logs | 7 years | Archive |

### Right to Erasure (GDPR Article 17)

Clients can request complete data deletion:

```python
# Complete client data deletion with secure overwrite
success = data_isolation_manager.delete_client_data(
    client_id="client_123",
    permanent=True  # Secure 3-pass overwrite (DOD 5220.22-M)
)
```

### Data Deletion Process
1. **Notification**: Client notified 30 days before deletion
2. **Export Option**: Data can be exported before deletion
3. **Secure Overwrite**: 3-pass random data overwrite
4. **Verification**: Cryptographic verification of deletion
5. **Certificate**: Deletion certificate provided

## 🌍 Compliance Frameworks
